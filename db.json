These Slayers protect humanity from Behemoths that are consuming the land following a cataclysmic event that turned the landscape into ever-changing, floating islands.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay may remind players of Monster Hunter, or perhaps a cheerier version of Shadow of the Colossus, where the goal is to defeat massive creates in an vast landscape.\r\n\r\nDauntless is playable solo, although it is designed with co-op play in mind. It boasts a variety of unique encounters and rewards players with items that will allow them to upgrade weapons and armor — enabling them to become even stronger warriors.",

      "description": "World of Tanks is a popular free to play multiplayer role playing team-based shooter game developed by Wargaming.net. World of Tanks is based around the middle of the 20th century, and features huge epic battles with various different game modes such as Standard, Assault, Encounter Battles, and an added bonus of 15 tanks vs 15 enemy tanks gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe game starts off with quite easy gameplay but eventuates into a more difficult game as you progress, and because a typical game only takes between 5-10 minutes the game can get quite intense as well. Unlike other games in World of Tanks you cannot respawn; so when your tank gets destroyed you tank gets destroy and you have to start a new game before you can play again. You can still watch the battlefield from a spectator but who wants to be a spectator when you can join in with action with a simple click of a button?\r\n\r\nA different aspect of World of Tanks is that you wait in a queue called a “lobby” and then are launched into a random map, with random enemy players. In World of Tanks depending on your gaming style you start off with a fast lightly armored tank, a middle of the range type of tank, or a slower, more heavily armored tank. The tanks are based on real authentic tanks that were in World War 2. There are approximately 150 tanks from 3 different countries, these being Germany, Russia, and the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe tank you choose can be customized by performing various different upgrades, which you can acquire through winning experience and credits you gain by winning battles against other enemy tanks. There are 10 different tiers, with tier 1 being a very weak tank going all the way up to tier 10 tanks which are the most powerful. Just like your tanks in the game your crew has a set of skills which progresses as you move through the different tiers in the game.\r\n\r\nYou can own multiple tanks but can only pilot 1 tank in any one game. Depending on what nation you choose will determine what research tree you will advance through to unlock new, more powerful tanks, weapons, and crew members to help your battles against the other enemy tanks. Since World of Tanks initial release there have been numerous updates to improve the difficulty, the visual aspects, new fresh maps, and new tanks and allow more exciting clan features of the game. If you like blowing up tanks, with a quick and intense game style you will simply love this game!",

      "description": "Warframe is a 3D free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter game set in an stunning sci-fi world. In the distant future, war against the Grineer Empire leads humanity to summon ancient warriors from the distant past. Called “Tenno,” these agile fighters are equally skilled in blades and guns, able to carve their way through scores of enemies with skill and aplomb. A vast arsenal of these human weapons are called upon in mankind’s darkest hour to rescue their brethren from total annihilation.\r\n\r\nAs one of these Tenno, staked with protecting humanity, you’ll root out the Grineer from all their hiding places, scouring the Solar System and eliminating this nefarious threat. You’ll choose from among dozens of deadly Warframes, each with its own set of skills and strengths. The game progresses through a series of levels, each themed around a planet or region of the Solar System, and each requiring a squad of four Tenno to clear. As you advance, you’ll unlock more power for your Tenno, including new weapons and skills, letting you take on even tougher enemies.\r\n\r\nTenno have a number of sweet moves at their disposal, including the ability to “parkour” over and around obstacles, ziplines they can balance on, wall-latching and wall-dashing, and more. Tenno are also spiritual warriors, able to channel energy to spectacular results, including augmenting their weapon damage or activating special powers. Even when downed in battle, Tenno can continue to fight and rally to continue their missions.\r\n\r\nBetween missions, you can purchase better weapons for your Tenno or even entirely new Warframes, so you can try out a different play style. Some items cost credits (in-game currency) while others require platinum, which is purchased with real money. You can also craft your own weapons and insert mods to make them more powerful. Your ship, the Liset, is also where you’ll select your next mission, which you can choose to be public, letting anyone join you, or private, which you can attempt with a pre-selected team.\r\n\r\nWarframe requires fast reflexes and split-second timing to execute a Tenno’s most dynamic moves. Because the game demands constant progression, and the resources required to purchase those progressions, a high skill factor is required, not only to play, but to play quickly enough to advance at a reasonable rate – and to keep up with your teammates. As such, there’s a lot of repetition required. If you want to quickly rip through content over and over, growing in power with each iteration, Warframe will suit you.",

Of course, this is a battle royale, so in addition to dealing with each other, players must contend with the ever-shrinking map.\r\n\r\nPlayers can choose between seven different champions, each with a unique super power. Speaking of powers, there’s also a bit of mysticism involved, with ancient ritual, hex bags, blood magic, and more. Players can use these skills to flood the map, summon zombies, and even teleport.\r\n\r\nOf course, it’s not all magick and powers. There are the standard weapons – all realistically modeled.These include anti-material guns, sniper rifles, Ars, rocket launchers and flamethrowers. Vehicles also have an impact on gameplay with players having access to military amphibians and speed boats.\r\n\r\nUnlike other battle royales, CRSED: F.O.A.D offers players a choice between third and first-person view when playing. This is achieved by equipping all players with a familiar with a camera that can see players peeking around a corner. \r\n\r\nPreviously described as an “all-kitchen-warfare battle royale game”, Cusine Royale started out as an April Fool’s joke from the developers of the MMO shooter Enlisted, and eventually took on a life of its own due to how popular it was with fans. But the new season and reboot, changes everything!\r\n\r\n",

Gaijin Entertainment is taking the vehicular multiplayer shooter genre full gear with Crossout.\r\n\r\nFollowing the double catastrophes of a failed genetic testing project and an alien invasion, players are thrown into a wasteland world not unlike that of Mad Max. The harsh, post-apocalyptic terrain of Crossout forces players to build and customize their vehicles to fight and endure the elements and other players. Hunker down in the in-game Workshop and use the countless parts earned in battle to craft a formidable death machine capable of laying waste to opponents.\r\n\r\nWeapons in Crossout range from roof-mounted miniguns to vehicular chainsaws and everything in between the player can imagine. But combat isn’t all there is to Crossout. The in-game economy is driven by the players, allowing them to trade the parts they’ve earned with one another to craft stronger, pitiless, machines. Vehicles in Crossout must be strong, for the damage a vehicle takes in battle will affect its performance. And when the enemy is charging with a vehicle-mounted powerdrill, peak performance is everything.  Crossout is everything players looking for the post-apocalyptic vehicular warfare experience could possibly want. Find a vehicle and turn it into a death-spitting chariot of war!",

      "short_description": "A free-to-play martial arts MMORPG that tasks players with learning combination attacks.",
      "description": "Blade & Soul is a free-to-play, action combat MMORPG from NCSoft that initially released in 2012 in Korea but finally saw a Western release in January 2016. Blade & Soul is a martial arts inspired MMORPG that tasks players with learning action combat based combination attacks for each class. Currently, there are 7 classes available in the game; Assassin, Blade Master, Destroyer, Force Master, Kung-Fu Master, Summoner, and Blade Dancer. New players will want to research the classes prior to starting a new character since classes fall under various race restrictions when choosing from one of the game’s four currently available races.\r\n\r\nBlade & Soul’s most notable feature is perhaps the game’s combat. Skills are learned as you level up and are displayed on hotbars in the traditional MMORPG style, but the actual implementation of those skills differs from most other games in the genre. While you will work with “rotations” in combat, it is perhaps better to think of these rotations in the form of “combinations” as each class will have a plethora of skills that can be combined in succession to perform very well animated combination attacks. These combinations may only be two or three buttons or they could be MUCH longer. Unlike other action combat MMOs though, Blade & Soul isn’t going to spoon feed you the combinations by hitting one key to trigger the next strike in the combination. Instead, Blade & Soul requires you to actually learn not only the combination itself, but each ability’s timing, and the required position to execute certain parts of the combination (Your hot bar actually can change based on position. i.e. being knocked down may give you access to abilities that cannot be used while standing). Learning these combination, aiming them appropriately, and reacting to incoming attacks are the key to the game’s fast paced and sometimes complex combat. If you liked TERA’s combat, you’ll probably enjoy Blade & Soul’s quite a bit.\r\n\r\nLeveling brings the usual grind of story, side, and repeatable quests but the game’s environments change so often and are very well rendered that you won’t get bored by the scenery for quite some time. Transportaion is handled with sprint, glide, and even water walking abilities to speed up any backtracking you may have do. Instant teleports are available by spending in-game currency. Leveling requires completion of quests and along the way players will gain gear that can be upgraded along with your character. Feed equipment that you don’t need to your sword, for example, and you get a sword that levels up as your character does. This primary upgrading mechanic applies to many different gear pieces and keeps players going after loot simply to “feed” their primary equipment.\r\n\r\nThe addition of a “Soul Shield” allows for extra stat customization provided you can find the pieces of the shield you desire. Skills can be further customized at about level 18 (it’s actually a story completion point that triggers this mechanic) by spending points in your martial tome to increase ability effectiveness.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy dungeons, Blade & Soul has quite a few options for you. Each dungeon (be it a full instance or just a cave on the world map) has numerous difficulty levels and varying party size requirements. This keeps the loot fest rolling as certain dungeons will drop the items needed to “Breakthrough” on your weapon and gear upgrading. The game’s matchmaking system makes finding a party for these runs very easy.\r\n\r\nBlade & Soul’s PvP is based on two main categories; World PvP and Arena PvP. Arena PvP is a 1v1 or 3v3/6v6 (currently only in Korea) affair. Versus matches are simply queued for while World PvP is based on what your character is wearing. You read that right. World PvP is based on what you are wearing. It’s a creative way to “flag” for PvP. Simply donning the costume of one of the game’s 2 factions makes you able to be attacked by a member of the opposing faction out in the world. Other costumes could turn normally friendly NPCs into enemy NPCs that will attack you on sight.\r\n\r\nBlade & Soul’s cash shop varies by geographic location but for the most part contains the normal consumables, costumes, and cosmetics. However, some materials are also available in the shop. The multiple shops actually utilize multiple currency types and a currency exchange system is in place to provide free players with a means to acquire cash shop items. A subscription service is also available and provides additional perks to players that opt for the payment.",

      "description": "ArcheAge is a free-to-play, hybrid fantasy/sandbox MMORPG brought to you by Trion Worlds. Set in the fantasy world of Erenor, players are sent out on a journey of their own choosing. Players start on one of two continents: Nuia, home of the elves or Harihara, home of the Ferres. After that, the choices are up to the player from where to go, to why, and what actions to perform.\r\n\r\nArcheAge offers four unique races which possess their own innate qualities with an additional ten skill trees that create up to one hundred and twenty class options. By choosing three of the ten basic skill types, players are essentially able to create their own class tailored to their own unique style of gameplay.\r\n\r\nPets can be purchased and trained into mounts or as companions on the battlefield. The crafting system features 21 professions whose actions are performed using labor points. Labor points are gained based on time spent in game (unless you are a premium member) and accumulate over time. There are 7 different levels of mastery for each profession and each level grants a crafting benefit of some sort to the player.\r\n\r\nArcheAge features both PvE and PvP options. PvE choices include the typical dungeons and quests, while PvP offers features such as the Justice System, Arenas, Naval Battles and World PvP. Community options go beyond what is typical for an MMORPG, and while guilds are a part of the community, there are also factions and families. Land ownership plays a great deal into the gameplay of ArcheAge with individual players and guilds vying for land any time a new zone is added into the game.\r\n\r\nWith so many options to choose from, ArcheAge affords players the unique opportunity to become completely immersed in their world.  From character creation, to the economy, to the community, to the sandbox style world; the choices are endless.",

You’ll pilot warplanes in exciting PvP dogfights and rumble across the battlefield in tanks, battling against foes on across several vintage maps, featuring diverse terrain and offering several strategic options. There are many different ways to play War Thunder, ranging from quick arcade mode-style combat to competitive, realistic battles.\r\n\r\nThe vehicles in War Thunder represent WWII-era tanks and planes from several different nations, including the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, and the USSR. Battles earn you currency you can use to upgrade your vehicles with better engines, weaponry, and other modifications, and you’ll also earn experience that you can use to unlock more vehicles and increase your crew’s performance. Planes include quick and agile fighters, giant flying fortresses, and precision bombers, while tanks run the gamut from light to heavy to self-propelled artillery. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and learning how to properly use your vehicles is the key to victory.\r\n\r\nThe most common game modes are PvP battles that revolve around a series of control points or that task players with destroying enemy vehicles, whether AI-controlled or belonging to other players. Each player brings a squad of up to five vehicles and, when your current vehicle is destroyed, you’ll choose another one to ride back into combat. You can also adjust battle realism, opting for simpler controls with target reticles and other helpful guides, or complete realism, with very few artificial elements in the way of aid. In addition to PvP battles, there are also PvE campaigns and missions you can take on alone or with other players. No matter how you play War Thunder, the action will be easy to find and the battles will have you on the edge of your seat!",

      "description": "Guild Wars 2 is a free-to-play open-world MMORPG, the follow-up to ArenaNet’s popular Guild Wars. Building on that first game’s guiding principles, it offers a huge world to explore, populated with dynamic events that can start at any time and provide excellent variety in gameplay. It also features PvP, both open-world and instanced, dungeons, raiding, storytelling, and everything else you’d expect in a full-featured massively multiplayer online RPG.\r\n\r\nYou’ll choose from among the five races of Tyria – human, norn, charr, sylvari, and asura – and one of several classes. Each class has remarkable versatility, allowing it to fill a number of roles in a party and reducing the need for a full MMO-style “trinity.” Characters have limited skill bars of 10 slots; the first five are determined by your weapon and the second five by skills that you choose: a healing skill, three utility skills, and an elite skill. Different classes have ways to access other skills, and most classes have the ability to swap out weapons, so you’ll still have some variety in exactly what tools you can bring to each fight.\r\n\r\nThe heart of Guild Wars 2 is its open-world content. While there is some static content, in the form of “hearts” that you can complete once for NPCs, most of the game revolves around dynamic events, which spring up in the world at various times and often require large groups of players to complete. There are no traditional quests that require you to speak to NPCs to accept or complete them; instead, you can simply go from event to event, helping the people of Tyria as you see fit. Some events are parts of larger chains that string together and culminate in a giant event against a great threat to Tyria and require a hundred or more players to complete.",

      "description": "Star Trek Online (STO) is a free-to-play, 3D, Sci-Fi MMORPG based on the popular Star Trek series. In this massively multiplayer online game brought to you by Cryptic Studios, players have many options to create their own destiny.\r\n\r\nDuring character creation players are afforded the ability to choose between three canonical races: Federation, Klingon and Romulan. Each of these races comes with their own inherent blend of racial traits and players have the opportunity to customize their own unique species.\r\n\r\nEnjoy a vast array of gameplay options as you explore iconic locations from the Star Trek series including Starfleet Academy, Deep Space Nine, The First City of Qo’nos, and many more.  Participate in many different mission types to advance your character such as Star Fleet missions (raids), Genesis System missions (exploration), and The Foundry, where you can create your own playable mission to share with your friends and the whole Star Trek Online Universe as well as participate in other user generated missions. With the Duty Officer System, there is opportunity for offline progression as well, though this is optional.\r\n\r\nStar Trek Online also has a skill-based crafting system which involves collecting various particles or data samples throughout the universe. With these particles and data samples, players are then able to craft items to assist them with their missions. As crafting skill increases, players are able to access a wider variety of more powerful items. Most items in the game can be upgraded for level and rarity and there is the opportunity to create Epic level items as well.\r\n\r\nThe MMORPG game can be downloaded for Windows from the Perfect World Entertainment platform, Arc Games, or from Steam. Perfect World Entertainment also offers a standalone Mac client download option.",

That is Roblox for you in a nutshell. Since Roblox’s main appeal is the vast variety of games created by users, it will be near impossible to explain gameplay in Roblox, since it will be completely different depending on which world you are playing in. Along with the thousands of games you can play on Roblox, it also has a social platform to it. You can follow different content creators and even add users on your friend’s list and interact with them within the game.\r\n\r\nThere are many feature in place within the Roblox servers that are designed to keep children safe. All chat is moderated and parents can easily track their kid’s activity within the game. One of the major rules in Roblox is the no dating rule, which helps keep the focus on playing and building games instead of deep social interaction of questionable nature.The game development portion of Roblox is one of the strongest features it has to offer. \r\n\r\nWith nearly unlimited possibilities, and its own programming language that is designed for teens to understand and learn, Roblox is an amazing engine for game programmers to hone their craft, along with making a couple bucks!",

      "description": "Entropia Universe is free to play 3D Sci-Fi MMORPG with interesting economic and social features. MindArk’s virtual economy universe is known by many names depending on when you started playing the game and what planet was the key planet at the time. While the game is free-to-play and does have some typical MMORPG elements (combat, questing, looting, etc) the primary difference between Entropia Universe and other games is the linking of a real world currency exchange.\r\n\r\nImagine this: you spend $10 USD to buy some in game currency. You then use that currency and your skills (like sweating monsters) to farm up items of value and triple your total in-game currency. Sounds familiar so far, right? Here’s where Entropia Universe differs though. You can exchange that in-game currency BACK into real world money whenever you want to do so at a fixed conversion rate. This means players can play their game, have some fun, and turn an actual real life profit if they work hard enough.\r\n\r\nThis primary economic mechanic had netted Entropia Universe some serious press as players buy and sell actual locations in game for hundreds of thousands of real life dollars. The game has also appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records earning titles multiple times for the most expensive virtual items ever sold.\r\n\r\nIn game, players aren’t really limited to classes. If you like combat, go for it. Want to be a surgeon? You can do that too. If you can find a way to earn money doing something, chances are that Entropia Universe will allow you to do it. If you’re looking for a slightly off the beaten path Sci-Fi MMO game and would like to take your chance at making some extra scratch, check out Entropia Universe.\r\n",

      "description": "Second Life is a free to play 3D online virtual world with a huge reputation, is one of the oldest Online Virtual worlds, and is still running strong even today. Second Life is, as the name suggests, virtually a second life that the player can logged into.\r\n\r\nUnlike most games where there is a set “goal” or “end” to work toward, Second Life doesn’t really have a linear story, nor does it follow the normal standard for video games. In Second Life, you start with an avatar that can be customized with a huge database filled with different cosmetic items. From there, you can do virtually anything you want. From Exploring countless zones and player created content, roleplaying with others, to using the game as a platform to socialize with others the way you would in real life, there really is no limit to what you can do in Second Life.\r\n\r\nSecond Life is filled with user generated content. You can choose to take part in that by creating your own content within Second Life, or just spend your time viewing and enjoying content made by fellow Second Life players. This type of content can be in the form of mini-games, buildings, or various types of sims. Second Life has a currency that creates an economy similar to that of the real world. “Linden Dollars” is the currency in Second life and it can even be traded for real world money, meaning that what you make in Second Life holds actual value, allowing people to make a living in Second Life if they choose to!\r\n\r\nIf you are someone that has hopped on the VR ban wagon, then Second Life is a title you need to check out. It has Oculus Rift support, which is a great way to see exactly what VR is capable of. It also adds another element to Second Life, making the game feel even closer to real life. If you are looking for an escape from your normal life, and have an idea of the perfect life you can’t obtain in the real world, then Second Life is for you!\r\n\r\n",

Mayhem offers different rules every week, Expeditions are the game’s story mode.

      "description": "SoulWorker is a free to play anime action MMO based on the popular anime of the same title. Developed by Lion Games, the game is being handled by a variety of publishers — including Gameforge in North America and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe game is a third-person action MMO designed in the same style as the anime. Players stake on the role of psychic teenagers with the ability to power special weapons called “Soul Workers,” which they will use to fight the monsters that have the vacant city of Cloudrealm. They won’t just be fighting, however, but also trying to discover what happened to the people who used to live in that city and possibly reverse it.\r\n\r\nPlayers get to choose between six different Soul Worker weapons — each aligning to a different class. These are: a chainsaw, a cannon, dual swords, dual pistols, a great sword, and a scythe. More powerful weapons can be obtained via crafting. There is also a limit-break style system — the Zenith attack — in which players who have accumulated enough Soul in combat are able to perform a powerful move related to their weapon. To make things even more interesting, two players can combine attacks into a more powerful one referred to as Coordination.\r\n\r\nVisually, the game is a 3D version of the anime it is inspired by. SoulWorker is slated for release later this year — although an exact date hasn’t been announced yet.",

Inspired by the Smash Bros. family of Nintendo games, Brawlhalla is a fast-and-furious smash-em-up featuring a bunch of colorful characters and enough tactical depth to satisfy even the most strategic of players. Play offline or online with up to seven other people, and brawl for bragging rights or for dominance in the ranked arena!\r\n\r\nThe warriors of Brawlhalla are a diverse lot. There are Vikings, pirates, cowboys, ninjas, and just about everything in between. All characters have the same basic moves, but weapon drops during matches can shake things up. Each fighter has two weapons he or she can pick up, each with distinctive attacks. Some warriors specialize in close-quarters combat, while others prefer to attack at range. Characters have both heavy and light attacks at their disposal, as well as plenty of aerial acrobatics they can perform. Matches end after a time limit, or when a sufficient number of kills have been reached.\r\n\r\nEach match in Brawlhalla can be fully customized for length, arena, and number of players. Play online with friends or with random opponents. You can compete in casual matches or take your skills to ranked 1v1 arenas by yourself or in 2v2 with a friend to climb up the ranking ladder. Matches can support up to eight players, in 4v4 team battles, or you can practice alone or against bots to master your moves.\r\n\r\nBrawlhalla is fully free-to-play, with no hidden costs or microtransactions apart from cosmetic changes. Blue Mammoth Games even gives players the option to refund their purchase, a limited number of times, if they’re unhappy with their selection. Whether you’re a hardcore ladder-climber or a button-mashing brawler, it all adds up to one of the most enjoyable games you’ll find online!",

      "description": "Forza Motorsport 6: Apex is a free-to-play multiplayer online racing game that comes from makers of one of the most popular video game racing series ever. It marks the first entry for the series on PC, after a decade on consoles. Microsoft and Turn 10 Studios bring the gameplay of Forza Motorsport 6 to Windows 10 machines with a many of the same features as its paid console counterpart.\r\n\r\nForza Motorsport 6 offers over 450 cars and 26 tracks, offering one of the most realistic racing experiences you can get in a video game. Races can have up to 24 players, competing on tracks found throughout the world and hand-crafted with exacting detail. Cars in the game include some of the most popular sports cars in the world, including the Lamborghini Huracan and the Ferrari 458 Italia. Tracks include such famous locales as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Nurburgring, and Watkins Glen.\r\n\r\nThe level of detail is astounding, from realistic damage modeling that gives you an idea of the wear and tear that your vehicle goes through, to spectacular weather effects, to dirt and grass modeling that will have you thinking you’re watching a race on TV. You can compete against human opponents or against the AI, which uses Forza’s innovative Drivatar technology to deliver an experience that’s as close to competition against real people as you can get.\r\n\r\nThough Forza Motorsport 6: Apex does have microtransactions, it will not have a VIP Pass in the same fashion as its console counterpart. Microtransactions in Apex focus on letting players avoid the most unpleasant parts of progression while not giving a competitive edge in the races themselves. The game is the first part of Microsoft’s refocusing on PC gaming, after spending over a decade concentrating on Xbox and Xbox One as the company’s primary gaming platform.",

      "description": "SNOW is a free-to-play skiing and snowboarding game that challenges players to compete solo against the clock or with friends in multiplayer modes to pull off the next big trick on the slopes without cracking your skull in the process. Poppermost Productions released the game into an Early Access/Open beta in late January 2016 with additional developments forthcoming based on player feedback.\r\n\r\nCurrently the game offers 6 different mountains for players to explore. Each mountain has multiple faces set up for speed runs, slalom matches, and trick competitions. Mountains and their sides can have differing difficulty levels and each can be explored in a “Free Roam” mode if desired.\r\n\r\nWhile the game features a cash shop, the contents of the cash shop are purely cosmetic with the exception of a few extra events that can be purchased and explored in addition to the myriad of events already available for free players. This focus on cosmetics allows SNOW to be a skill heavy game.\r\n\r\nAs of the time of this writing, SNOW does not allow any keybinding changes (although the menu has a spot for keybinding so look for it to be implemented soon) and does not support a controller so players will have to get used to some heavy finger dexterity to pull off the trickier flips, grabs, and grinds. Players familiar with the Shaun White or SSX series of games will be familiar with the core trick gameplay.\r\n\r\nW, A, S, and D controls your character (there is currently no real customization in game except for swapping out gear) and provide speed, turning, and braking while on the ground. Get some air under you and the control scheme changes to W, A, S, andD controlling your flip and turn directions and the up, down, left, and right arrows trigger grab moves when used singly or in various combinations. Left Shift is used to put a faster rotation on your flips and turns and Space Bar is used to jump. Players can even let loose a drone to scope out the field ahead of them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a run or event, points are converted into experience to level up your character and cash shop currency is occasionally given out as a reward for those that don’t wish to actually spend money to sport a horse head while skiing. (Yes, that horse head thing is actually an option…along with a TON of other crazy costume options.)\r\n\r\nBe warned, SNOW takes a bit of getting used to and occasionally the physics of the game are a bit wonky. This is particularly noticeable when trying to pull of grind tricks on rails or other structures. That being said, it is funny to see your character grinding away on a rail while being stuck in an impossible position.\r\n\r\nFor skiing and snowboarding fans, SNOW is a great option in the multiplayer landscape or for those just looking for a bit of free PC fun.",
